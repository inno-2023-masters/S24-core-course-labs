### Check container name after command `terraform apply -var "container_name=ExampleName"`
to check if the container name is changed I run command docker ps to view information about containers:
```
sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                  NAMES
72b538d307d9   1d668e06f1e5   "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   23 seconds ago   Up 22 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   ExampleName
```

### Result of the `terraform output` command
```
container_id = "fcc1c602f601fa9d9bd6b99e95d0ce545e05d1e81b2b2ad018fd3f56b8cafcae"
image_id = "sha256:1d668e06f1e534ab338404ba891c37d618dd53c9073dcdd4ebde82aa7643f83fnginx:latest"
```

### To create cloud VM I used yandex-cloud services instead of AWS.
You can see configuration of the cloud VM in file app_python/yandex-cloud/main.tf
After ```terraform apply``` I get following ip of the VM as an output:
```
external_ip_address_vm_1 = "51.250.95.139"
internal_ip_address_vm_1 = "192.168.10.31"
```
