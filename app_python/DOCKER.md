# Docker Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines best practices employed within the Dockerfile for the containerization of the Flask application.

## Best Practices Employed:
1. **Multi-Stage Builds:** Utilizing multi-stage builds helps reduce the final image size by separating build dependencies from the runtime environment.

2. **Minimize Image Layers:** Combining multiple commands into a single `RUN` instruction and cleaning up unnecessary files in the same layer minimizes the number of layers in the final image.

3. **Use Specific Base Images:** Employing a precise version of the base image (`python:3.8-slim` in this case) ensures consistency and stability across deployments. Consider using even more lightweight images like `python:3-alpine3.15` for further optimization.

4. **User Privilege Separation:** Creating a non-root user (`appuser`) and switching to it improves security by reducing the potential impact of security vulnerabilities.

5. **Copy Only Necessary Files:** Instead of copying the entire directory, specific files and directories are copied into the image, reducing unnecessary file inclusion.

6. **Use .dockerignore:** Specifying a `.dockerignore` file to exclude irrelevant files and directories during the build process helps optimize the build context and reduces the size of the final image.
