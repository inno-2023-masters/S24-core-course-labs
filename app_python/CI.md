# CI Best Practices

1. **Automate the Build**: Ensure that the build process is automated so that every code change triggers a build to catch issues early.

2. **Use Version Control**: Always use version control for your codebase to track changes and facilitate collaboration.

3. **Isolate Dependencies**: Use tools like Docker to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency across different environments.

4. **Run Tests**: Include automated tests in your CI pipeline to verify the code changes and catch regressions.

5. **Linting**: Integrate linters to enforce coding standards and maintain code quality.

6. **Parallelize Builds**: Speed up the build process by running tests and other tasks in parallel where possible.

7. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on build times and performance metrics to optimize the CI pipeline.

8. **Security Scans**: Integrate security scans to detect vulnerabilities in dependencies and code.

9. **Incremental Builds**: Optimize your build process to only build and test what has changed to reduce build times.

10. **Feedback Loop**: Ensure that developers receive feedback on their changes quickly to encourage best practices and rapid iteration.
