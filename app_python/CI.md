# Continuous Integration Best Practices

## Workflow Status Badge
We've added a workflow status badge to our repository for visibility. This badge shows the status of our CI pipeline and can be found at the top of our `README.md` file.

## Best Practices
We've implemented several best practices to optimize our CI workflow:

- We set timeouts for our workflows to prevent them from running indefinitely.
- We limit the scope of our workflow token to reduce the potential damage if it's compromised.
- We pin our actions to specific SHAs to ensure that we use a specific version of an action.
- We consider setting up a concurrency strategy to prevent multiple workflows from running at the same time.
- We consider which triggers are really needed to reduce unnecessary workflow runs.
- We use secrets for confidential data (Docker Hub's username and token,Snyc token );

## Build Cache
We've utilized build cache to enhance our workflow efficiency. We cache our Python dependencies, and the cache is used in subsequent runs if the `requirements.txt` file hasn't changed.
