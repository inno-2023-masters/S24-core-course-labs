# CI/CD Workflow

This YAML file outlines a continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) workflow. Here are the best practices applied in this workflow:

## Key Practices:

1. **Version Control Integration**: The workflow triggers on every push event in the repository, ensuring changes are tested and deployed automatically.

2. **Workflow Jobs**: Defines a single job named "build" that runs on an Ubuntu environment.

3. **Use of Standard Environments**: Utilizes the `ubuntu-latest` environment, ensuring compatibility and availability of necessary tools and dependencies.

4. **Dependency Management**: Sets up Python 3.11, upgrades pip to the latest version, and installs project dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

5. **Code Quality Checks**:
   - **Flake8**: Installs Flake8 for linting and code style enforcement.
   - **McCabe Complexity Analysis**: Configures Flake8 to run with McCabe analysis, checking for code complexity.

6. **Testing**:
   - Runs unit tests using Python's built-in `unittest` module, discovering tests in the `app_python` directory.

7. **Security Scanning**:
   - **Snyk**: Performs security scanning to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies. Continues execution even if errors are encountered during scanning.

8. **Docker Image Handling**:
   - **Docker Hub Login**: Accesses Docker Hub credentials securely from repository secrets for authentication.
   - **Image Building**: Builds a Docker image tagged with the latest version.
   - **Image Pushing**: Pushes the built Docker image to the Docker Hub repository.

9. **Secret Management**: Docker Hub credentials and Snyk token are accessed from repository secrets, ensuring security and confidentiality.

10. **Error Handling**: Includes error handling mechanisms, such as continuing execution after encountering errors in Snyk scanning.

11. **Parallel Execution**: Although not explicitly specified, some steps like dependency installation, linting, testing, and security scanning can potentially run in parallel, speeding up the overall workflow execution time.

12. **Descriptive Naming**: Each step in the workflow is given a clear and descriptive name, enhancing readability and understanding of the workflow's purpose.
