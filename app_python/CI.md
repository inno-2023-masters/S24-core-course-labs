## 1. Best Practices applied for CI Workflow

### Caching

In CI workflows, caching can be used to store dependencies, build artifacts, and other files that are used frequently.
By caching these files, the CI workflow can avoid downloading and building the same files repeatedly, which can
significantly reduce the time it takes to run the workflow.

### Permissions

When setting up CI workflows, it is important to ensure that the necessary permissions are granted to the workflow.
For example, only to read from the repository.

### Latest actions

It is important to keep the CI workflow up to date with the latest actions and best practices.
