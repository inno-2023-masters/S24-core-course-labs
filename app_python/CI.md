# Best Practices for Continuous Integration

## Use Environment Variables
- Store sensitive information such as API keys, tokens, and passwords in environment variables to keep them secure.
- Use environment variables to store configuration settings and secrets.

## Implement Build Caching
- Utilize build caching to speed up the build process by reusing previously built dependencies and artifacts.
- Cache dependencies and build outputs to enhance workflow efficiency.

## Use Workflow Status Badges
- Add a workflow status badge to repository to provide visibility into the status of CI workflow.

## Integrate Snyk Vulnerability Checks
- Integrate Snyk into CI workflow to identify and address vulnerabilities in project.
- Use Snyk to scan and monitor dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
