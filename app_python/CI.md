# CI Best Practices

## Using Secrets

- Store sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and access tokens,
  securely using built-in secrets management features provided by CI/CD
  platforms.

## Caching Dependencies

- Utilize caching mechanisms provided by CI/CD platforms to cache dependencies,
  such as Python packages. This reduces the time required for dependency
  installation in subsequent workflow runs, improving overall workflow
  efficiency.

## Linting

- Implement code linting as part of the CI pipeline to enforce coding standards
  and identify potential issues in the codebase. Incorporating code linting into
  the CI workflow helps maintain consistent code quality and improves overall
  code readability.
