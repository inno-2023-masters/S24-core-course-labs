### Best practices

1. **Dependency caching**: By saving dependencies between workflow runs, Python dependencies can be cached to shorten build times. This is accomplished by employing a hash of the `requirements.txt` file and a cache key dependent on the operating system to cache the {~/.cache/pip} directory.

2. **Environment setup**: Installing `actions/setup-python@v2} and configuring the Python environment with the desired version. This guarantees a standardized setting for the project's development and testing.

3. **Code linting**: Code linting is the process of examining the Python code for syntactic and stylistic issues with `flake8}. This keeps the project's code consistent and of high quality.

4. **Unit testing**: Using `python -m unittest` to run unit tests will help you make sure the code works as intended and identify any regressions brought about by new updates.

5. **Vulnerability scanning**: Integrating Snyk to scan project dependencies for vulnerabilities. This aids in locating and fixing security holes in the project dependencies.

6. **Docker image build and push**: Building a Docker image and uploading it to Docker Hub using the Dockerfile located in the `app_python} directory. This makes it possible for the program to be distributed and deployed with ease.
