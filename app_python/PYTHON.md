### I chose Flask as a framework. Why?

1. It is simple to develop, it has well-defined lightweight structure.
2. Flask is suitable for small-size application as we need to develop.
3. I wrote web apps with Flask earlier.

### Applied best practice

1. Project Structure
    - I used proper names for functions/files/folders
    - Logical function placed in "utils" file, to be divided from the app level.
2. The project has file requirements.txt and documentation of the run in file "README.md"
3. Code is commented out
4. Tests structure for PyTest
    - I placed test in a "test" folder
    - all test's names have same pattern: "test_*"
5. Add linting using pylint.

### Coding standards

I used function of PyCharm to ensure that my code is correlate with PEP8 standards.
Also, I wrote comments there it can be useful.

### Testing
I used PyTest to run tests and "coverage" extension to know test coverage - it is 98% now.
