# Python Web Application Best Practices

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization

- The project follows a modular structure to enhance maintainability.
- Each component, such as routes, templates, and static files, is organized into separate directories.
- As for the naming convention, 'lower_with_under' and 4 spaces as indentation has used.  
### 2. PEP 8 Compliance

- The Python code adheres to PEP 8 coding standards for readability and consistency. VS Code has been used.

### 3. Comments and Documentation

- Code is well-documented with inline comments for complex sections and function docstrings for clarity.
- External documentation is maintained for project setup, dependencies, and usage.

### 4. Version Control

- A clean `.gitignore` file is used to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control.
- Descriptive commit messages are employed for better tracking and collaboration.

## Testing

There are no automated tests, however it is assured that program is working via manual testing.

## README.md in app_python Folder

Proper readme file has provided.

### Project Overview

Provide a brief overview of the Python web application, its purpose, and features.
This app developed on Python3 and html. We used Flask framework as our web application. Its purpose is showing the time in Moscow, Russia. It is not dependent on the devices' timezone, It always shows the Moscow time and update itself automatically every second. For more readibility we used styling. 
 
### Installation
Download the file, then run python file by 
```bash
python3 app.py
```
Then you can open the website by entering http://127.0.0.1:5000
