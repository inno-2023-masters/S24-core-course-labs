# Time Table app development

## Development

I've decided to run simple web server using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework.
It's pretty easy and fast framework for simple web applications.

## Quality

In order to ensure code quality:

- I used [RuFF](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) exstension and integrated `RuFF Github Action` into github repository. RuFF will ensure, that code is written according to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standart.

For readability:

- The code were written in the most consise way with proper naming conventions.
- It was properly commented according to [PEP257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) standart.

## Testing

As a result, application shows time on every page refresh:
