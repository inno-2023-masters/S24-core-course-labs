# Best practices for a Python web application

## Framework

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) framework was used to create web application.

It easy to use, have all necessary functional: request handling, easy response,
HTML page formatting.

## Best Practices:
- Clear variable names and comments.

## Coding Standards:
- Adherence to PEP 8.

## Testing:
- Basic testing. Just how to writen in lab.

## Code Quality:
- Basic refactoring.

# Unit Tests

## Description

In this project, comprehensive unit tests have been implemented to ensure the correctness and reliability of the `get_time()` function in the `time_web.py` module. These unit tests cover various aspects of the function's behavior, including its output format and handling of different scenarios.

## Unit Test Coverage

1. **test_get_time_format**: This test verifies that the output of the `get_time()` function has the correct format, ensuring that it returns a string containing the current time in the expected format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`).

## Best Practices Applied

- **Isolation**: Each unit test is isolated and independent, ensuring that the outcome of one test does not affect another.
- **Coverage**: Unit tests cover various scenarios, including normal operation and edge cases, to provide comprehensive coverage of the function's behavior.
- **Readability**: Test names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention (`test_<function_name>_<scenario>`), making it easy to understand the purpose of each test.
- **Assertions**: The use of `assert` statements ensures that the expected conditions are met during the execution of each test, providing clear feedback on test failures.
- **Documentation**: Unit tests and best practices are documented in the `PYTHON.md` file, making it easy for developers to understand the testing approach and contribute to the project.
