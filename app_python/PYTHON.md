# Python Web Application Best Practices

## Best Practices Applied

### Flask Application Structure

- Organized the project with proper separation of concerns: templates and the main application logic.
- Used the Flask framework because it is simple and efficient to develop small to medium web applications.

### Timezone Handling

- Integrated `pytz` to accurately convert timezone to make sure the correct current time in Moscow is displayed.

## Coding Standards

- Used meaningful variable and function names for clarity.
- Implemented error handling to catch potential exceptions, particularly around timezone management.

## Testing and Code Quality

- Conducted manual testing by refreshing the web page to ensure the displayed Moscow time updates correctly.
- Recommended automated testing for more complex scenarios, although not implemented due to the application's
  simplicity.
- Encouraged the use of code linters and formatters (e.g., flake8, black) to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Ensuring Code Quality

- Advised on regular code reviews for larger projects to detect issues early and enforce coding standards.
- Suggested setting up Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines to automate testing and linting for every push, ensuring
  code quality over time.
