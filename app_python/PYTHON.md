# Justification for Flask

## Why Flask?

Flask was chosen for this project because of its simplicity. Since the application's requirements are quite easy, Flask provides the features without any complexity. And since the purpose of the course is DevOps engineering practice, not the Web Development, I think Flask would be quite optimal and straightforward framework.

## Best practices

- In my project, i will use git as source code management. So i prepared a proper `.gitignore` file for python projects.

- Used proper file naming, as well as proper class, variables naming.

- Described starting points in `README.md`. All the steps and requirements.

- Used unit tests for testing the business logic behind the `app.py`
