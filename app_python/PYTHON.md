# Project Description

## Framework Selection
For this project, I picked Flask. For Python, I think there are 3 goto solution- Django, FastAPI and Flask. Since, FastAPI is mainly for REST API and the project is to display time on screen, FastAPI was not a good choice. Django was way too heavy for this project. So, I picked Flask.
