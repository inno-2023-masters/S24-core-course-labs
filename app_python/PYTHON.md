## Why I chose Flask?
Flask is a popular web framework for Python. It is a simple and easy to use framework that is perfect for beginners. It is also very flexible and can be used to create a wide range of web applications. Flask is also very well documented and has a large community of users, so it is easy to find help and support when you need it.

## Best practices applied in the web application
- **Coding standards and quality**: In the project was used the PEP 8 standard, which is the official style guide for Python code. It is important to follow this standard to ensure that the code is easy to read and understand.
- **Requirements**: The project has a requirements.txt file that contains all the dependencies that are needed to run the application. This is important to ensure that the application can be easily installed and run on different systems.
- **Testing**: The project has a test suite that contains unit tests for all the different parts of the application. This is important to ensure that the application is working as expected and to catch any bugs or issues before they are deployed to production.
- **Documentation**: The project has a README file that contains information about how to install and run the application. This is important to ensure that other developers can easily understand and work with the code.

## Code Quality
The code quality was checked using the Pylint tool. The application has a score of 7.86/10.

## Unit Tests
The application has a unit test which checks if the home page returns a 200 status code and if the content of the page is correct.
### Best practices applied in the unit tests
- **Test coverage**: The unit tests cover all code of the application to ensure that they are working as expected.
- **Test isolation**: The unit tests are isolated from other parts of code to ensure that they do not interfere with each other and that they can be run independently.
- **Readable and maintainable**: The unit tests are written in a way that is easy to read and understand, and that they can be easily maintained and updated.
