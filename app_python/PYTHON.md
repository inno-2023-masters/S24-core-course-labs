## Justification for Framework of Choice

I chose Flask because it is a lightweight framework that is easy to use and has a simple syntax. It is also easy to set up and has a built-in development server and debugger. Also, it has a great community. Moreover, I have experience with other frameworks such as Django, and I wanted to try something new.

## Coding Standards and Best Practices
- The project follows the PEP 8 coding standards for Python. 
- It uses the Flask framework, which is a micro web framework for Python. 
- It uses the Jinja2 templating engine for rendering the HTML templates, which is a recommended best practice for Flask.
