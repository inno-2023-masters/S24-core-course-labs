# Python Web Application

## Framework Choice: Flask

I chose to use the Flask framework for this Python web application for the following reasons:

- **Simplicity**: Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use framework, which makes it ideal for small projects and prototyping.
- **Flexibility**: Flask allows for flexibility in project structure and doesn't impose strict conventions, making it easy to customize according to project requirements.
- **Suitability**: For a simple web application like displaying the current time in Moscow, Flask provides all the necessary features without unnecessary complexity.

## Additional Notes

- The application displays the current time in Moscow by utilizing the `pytz` library to handle time zones.
- The code follows best practices and coding standards recommended for Flask applications.

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Modular Structure**: The application follows a modular structure with separate modules for routes, templates, and static files, promoting code organization and maintainability.

2. **Flask Framework**: Leveraging Flask, a lightweight and modular micro web framework, allows for easy development and scalability of the application.

3. **Template Rendering**: HTML templates are used for rendering views, separating presentation logic from business logic.

## Coding Standards

1. **PEP 8**: Coding style adheres to the PEP 8 guidelines, ensuring consistency and readability throughout the codebase.

2. **Descriptive Naming**: Descriptive and meaningful variable and function names are used, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Testing

**Manual testing** since the problem is quite simple(all business logic is literally just 3 lines of code), so I conclude that manual testing is enough
