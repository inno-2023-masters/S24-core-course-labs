# Python Web Application Best Practices

## Best Practices in the Web Application:

- **Modularity**: The web application is structured in a modular way, with separate routes defined for different functionalities.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The application separates concerns by having clear separation between the business logic, HTML templates, and static assets.
- **Security**: No sensitive information is exposed, and appropriate measures such as using HTTPS can be implemented for secure communication.


## Coding Standards, Testing, and Code Quality:

### Coding Standards:
The code follows PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style and formatting. Variable names are descriptive, functions are appropriately named, and indentation is consistent.
### Testing:
Unit tests are implemented using the `unittest` module to ensure the correctness of the application's functionality. Tests cover critical parts of the application such as routing and template rendering.
Best practices in unit testing:
1.  Use of setUp Method
The setUp method is used to prepare the testing environment before each test method runs.

2. Using Test Client for Simulating Requests

3. Clear and Concise Test Methods

4. Assert Methods for Validating Responses

5. Running Tests Conditionally
Including the if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main() block allows the test file to be run directly from the command line.
