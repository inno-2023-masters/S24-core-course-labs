# Answers to Lab 1

## 1. Why I chose Flask as a framework for my web application?

### Familiar

I have been using Flask for a while now and I am familiar with it.
I have used it to build a few web applications, and I am comfortable with it.

### Lightweight

Flask is lightweight and easy to use.
It is not as feature-rich as Django, but it is perfect for small to medium-sized web applications.

### Flexibility

Flask is very flexible and allows me to use any database, template engine, or other libraries of my choice.
By default, it uses Jinja2 as a template engine, which is very powerful and easy to use.

### Community

Flask has a large community and a lot of resources available online.
I can easily find help and resources if I run into any issues.

## 2. Best practices applied in my web application

### Structure

I have structured my web application in a way that makes it easy to understand and maintain.

### Comments

I have added comments to my code to explain what each part does.

### Tests

I have written tests for my web application to ensure that it works as expected.

### Templates

I have used templates to separate the presentation from the logic.
It makes my code cleaner and easier to maintain and extend.

## 3. How I followed coding standards, implemented testing, and ensured code quality

### Coding Standards

I have followed PEP 8 coding standards for Python. I have used consistent indentation, naming conventions, and other
coding standards.

### Testing

I have written unit tests for my web application using the built-in unittest module in Python.

### Code Quality

I have used pylint to check my code for any errors or bad practices.
