# Python Web Application Best Practices

## Best Practices Applied

### Flask Application Structure

- Organized the project with proper separation of concerns: templates and the main application logic.
- Used the Flask framework because it is simple and efficient to develop small to medium web applications.

### Timezone Handling

- Integrated `pytz` to accurately convert timezone to make sure the correct current time in Moscow is displayed.

## Coding Standards

- Used meaningful variable and function names for clarity.

## Testing and Code Quality

- Conducted manual testing by refreshing the web page to ensure the displayed Moscow time updates correctly.

## Ensuring Code Quality

- Formatted code with PyCharm
- Excluded `.venv` folder
