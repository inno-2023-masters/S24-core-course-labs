# CSharp application

This document describe the structure of a web application written in CSharp.

## Framework chosen

ASP.NET is used as the main web framework for the application.

### Reasons behind choosing ASP.NET

1. Familiarity

2. Scalibility

## Best practices, and how I used them

1. **Dependency injection**: In this project I used dependency injection instead of normal ways of dependency, it made testing much easier and the code more readable.

2. **Project structure**: I used a common project structure for ASP.NET project.

## Testing

I wrote test to check that the return string is eaither do it or not.

## Ensure code quality

C# dev tool extension insures the quality of the code.
