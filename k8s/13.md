## StatefulSet Exploration

**Difference in Behavior of StatefulSet and Deployment**

The predicted behavior is a fundamental feature of StatefulSet functionality. In a StatefulSet, each pod has its own
unique network identity and attached storage. This enables every pod to save its own state data.

The counter is only increased for that particular pod when a request is sent to the program. This is why the counts
differ among the pods. It's crucial to remember that when user requests are routed to the pods, load balancing and 
service routing rules may also affect these numbers.


**Ordering guarantees**

Applications sometimes need to deploy pods in a specified order in order to maintain consistency and good 
synchronization.
 For instance, it might be essential for the first pod (index 0) to be operational and ready before 
launching the second pod in a database application with many copies. This guarantees database consistency 
by allowing the second pod to synchronize with the first pod.

However, in my Flask application there is no need in specific ordering as pods do not share any resources, except from
hardware.
