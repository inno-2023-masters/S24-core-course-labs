## Difference

Each pod in a StatefulSet has its own network identity and attached storage, making it possible for each pod to maintain its own state information. Upon receiving a request, only the counter for the pod that processes that request is increased. This leads to disparate counts among the pods. It's key to understand that these counts could fluctuate, driven by load balancing and service routing rules that guide the distribution of user requests to the pods.

## Ordering

When it comes to ordering guarantees in pod deployment, there are situations where a specific sequence is essential to ensure synchronization and consistency. For example, in a database application with multiple replicas, it is crucial for the initial pod (index 0) to be active and prepared before launching the second pod. This ensures that the second pod can synchronize its data from the first pod, thereby maintaining uniformity in the database.

## Parallel Operations

StatefulSet is a Kubernetes feature that offers ordering guarantees, typically resulting in a step-wise start and termination of pods. However, if stateful application does not require such ordering guarantees, we have the option to run pods in parallel.

To enable parallel execution of pods, add the following line to the spec section of StatefulSet's YAML file:

```
podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"
```

By setting the podManagementPolicy to "Parallel", the StatefulSet controller will create and delete all pods simultaneously, allowing for faster and more efficient pod management.
