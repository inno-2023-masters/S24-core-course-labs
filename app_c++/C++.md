# Developing a C++ Application for Time Left Until Summer

I will give a brief description of the C++ program created to determine and show the amount of time till summer officially begins in this document.

## Best practices

1. Using Meaningful Variable and Function Names
2. Following a Consistent Coding Style
3. Avoiding Global Variables

## Project Overview

The C++ Time Left Until Summer App is a straightforward but instructive project that blends web programming and C++. Here are some salient details regarding the project:

- **Time Calculation**: Using a preset date (such as June 1st), the application determines how much time is left until the summer season begins.
- **HTTP Server**: It uses the `cpp-httplib` library to build a C++ HTTP server that is lightweight.

## Code Structure

The project's essential elements consist of:

- **C++ Server**: The server is implemented in C++ and uses specified HTTP endpoints to serve the HTML page and the time data.
- **Time Calculation**: To calculate how much time is remaining until summer, time calculation logic is used.

## Installation and Usage

To run the application locally, follow the installation and usage instructions provided in the project's [README.md](README.md) file.

## Conclusion

A sample of a C++ application that combines web technologies with C++ is the C++ Time Left Until Summer App. It showcases the potential of C++ in web development when coupled with libraries like `cpp-httplib`. The project's open nature encourages collaboration and contributions from the developer community.
