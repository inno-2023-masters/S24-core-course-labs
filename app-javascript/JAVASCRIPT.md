# Node.js Express Web Application

## Framework Choice: Express

For this Node.js web application, I chose Express as the web framework. Express is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, making it ideal for building lightweight and efficient web applications.

## Implementation Details: Check the README.md file

## Best Practices

1. **Code Comments:** The code includes comments to explain key functionalities, such as retrieving the current date and time in the specified timezone.

2. **Code Quality:** The code is concise and straightforward, focusing on the core functionality of displaying the current time in Moscow. However, additional comments and documentation could enhance readability and maintainability.

## How To Install and Test

To run the Node.js Express web application, follow these steps:

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
   - Install the required dependencies by running:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   - After installing dependencies, navigate to the directory containing the `app.js` file.
   - Run the following command to start the Express server:
     ```
     node app.js
     ```

4. **Test:**

   - Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000/` to access the application.
   - You should see the current time in Moscow displayed on the webpage.
   - Refresh the browser tab to ensure the application continues to work as expected.
