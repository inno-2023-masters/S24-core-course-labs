# TYPESCRIPT.md
This document outlines the TypeScript practices and standards applied in our web application.

## Framework Selection
For our TypeScript web application, we chose Express.js as our primary framework. Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, offering a simple way to define routes and middleware to handle HTTP requests.

## Best Practices
* Type annotations used throughout our codebase to ensure type safety and improve code readability. This practice helps catch bugs early and makes the code easier to understand for other developers.
* Large interfaces broken down into smaller, role-specific ones. This practice improves reusability and reduces coupling between components.

## Testing
* While our application is simple, typescript web application manually tested by browser Chrome.
